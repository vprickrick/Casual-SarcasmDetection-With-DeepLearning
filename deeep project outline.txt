DEEP LEARNING PROJECT 
TITLE : SARCASIM DETECTION MODEL &  

1) dataset used: News Headlines Dataset 
Supplement with:
&
reddit sarcasim : To diversify into informal social media sarcasm

comment: By prioritizing the News Headlines dataset and supplementing with contextual or social media data, you’ll achieve a robust foundation for both detection and generation tasks. Let me know if you need help with dataset integration


2)PREPROCESSING STEPS:--Text Normalization:

Lowercase all text.

Expand contractions (can’t → cannot).

Remove URLs and non-critical punctuation (keep !, ?, ...).

--Tokenization:

Use RoBERTa tokenizer 
--Feature Extraction:

Flag sentiment contrast (e.g., positive words in sarcastic headlines via VADER)



3)Feature Engineering
Sentiment Analysis: Use tools like VADER or fine-tune a sentiment model to detect contrast (e.g., "Great job!" with negative context).

Contextual Embeddings: Extract embeddings from BERT/RoBERTa.

Linguistic Markers:

Punctuation patterns (!, ?, …), uppercase words, hyperbolic phrases.

POS tagging (e.g., irony often uses adverbs like "totally").



4) model archetecture & optimization:
( on each dataset do archetcture optimiztion)

(Sarcasm Detection Architecture
Base Model: DistilBERT + Contextual Adaptation.

Handles both formal (News Headlines) and informal (SARC/iSarcasm) text effectively.

Architecture Customizations
Contextual Input Formatting:
 
For datasets requiring context (e.g., SARC’s parent-child comments or iSarcasm’s tweet threads):


Concatenate DistilBERT’s embeddings with handcrafted features (e.g., sentiment contrast from VADER, punctuation density):


Training Strategy:

Phase 1: Fine-tune on News Headlines (formal sarcasm).

Phase 2: Continue training on SARC/iSarcasm (informal sarcasm) with 10x lower learning rate.)

4)Training & Evaluation




(Start with RoBERTa + CNN if you want a balance of context and local pattern detection.

Compare results with pure RoBERTa fine-tuning to see if the CNN adds value.)

Hybrid Approach:

Concatenate RoBERTa embeddings with sentiment scores and linguistic features.

Add dense layers for classification.







I have used the advanced text preprocessing code, now I would like to carry on  the next step, I want to use Start with Start with RoBERTa fine-tuning, and then later try RoBERTa + CNN  to see if the CNN adds value.

Recommendation: Use RoBERTa-base or Twitter-RoBERTa (if your data has tweets). For Reddit-heavy data, use RoBERTa-large.

Improvements over Basic Model:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regularized Model vs Basic Model:
  - Accuracy: -1.54%
  - F1 Score: +3.17%
  - Training Time: +175.00%
FastText Model vs Basic Model:
  - Accuracy: +15.38%
  - F1 Score: -11.11%
  - Training Time: +175.00%


Overall Advantages and Differentiators
- Tailored to Casual Language:
Many traditional sarcasm detection systems are created for datasets with relatively standard language (e.g., news headlines). Your chosen models, particularly with features like subword embeddings and dynamic padding, are tailored to handle the informal, often inconsistent nature of social media language, where sarcasm is frequently implicit and context-dependent.
- Computational Efficiency:
By using lighter architectures (LSTM-based with attention rather than huge transformer models), you balance performance with the need for quick training and inference. This is crucial when you work with limited computational resources or need real-time processing.
- Enhanced Robustness:
Advanced regularization techniques (e.g., noise injection and contextual dropout) and multi-headed attention in one of your models improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This is particularly important for social media contexts, where distribution shifts (new slang, platform-specific jargon) are common.
- Practical Adaptability:
The models can be incrementally improved: you can start with the Base Model for quick prototyping and then experiment with the Advanced or FastText-enhanced approaches if you need more nuanced understanding—all without a huge leap in computational cost. This makes it easier to test and deploy in diverse operational settings.
By focusing on these lighter yet robust architectures, your approach mitigates the inherent challenges of casual sarcasm detection on platforms like Reddit and Twitter. It diverges from conventional methods primarily used in more structured domains, providing a more flexible framework for handling the fluid nature of social media language.

- Parameter Count and Memory Usage:
- Transformer models: For instance, BERT‑base has around 110 million parameters, and RoBERTa is of a comparable or larger scale.
- Light architectures (e.g., GloVe-BiLSTM, Advanced Regularized, FastText Enhanced): These typically have far fewer parameters (often in the single-digit or low tens of millions).
- Difference: In many cases, the lightweight models can have 80–90% fewer parameters and therefore use a similar percentage less memory. This means they are much more suited to environments with constrained memory.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Sarcasm detection poses unique challenges in natural language processing due to its reliance on contextual, cultural, and tonal cues. This project develops and evaluates three deep learning models---a \textbf{GloVe-embedded Bidirectional LSTM} with attention mechanisms, a \textbf{regularized hybrid model} with multi-head attention and noise injection, and a \textbf{FastText-enhanced network} optimized for subword pattern recognition---to classify sarcasm in 13{,}000 Twitter and Reddit posts.

\subsection{Related Work}

Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved sarcasm detection in social media text. Early work by Joshi2017 demonstrated the effectiveness of rule-based patterns and lexical features, while Cheng2020 pioneered CNN architectures for sarcasm classification on Twitter data. Subsequent studies explored contextual embeddings: Schifanella2021 achieved 68\% accuracy using BERT variants on Reddit posts, and Wang2022  incorporated attention mechanisms with BiLSTM for improved contextual awareness.

\subsection*{Workflow Explanation}
The methodology follows seven key stages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Collection}: Aggregation of 13,000 sarcastic/non-sarcastic posts from Twitter (65\%) and Reddit (35\%), preserving contextual metadata and platform-specific formatting

    \item \textbf{Text Preprocessing}:
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Tokenization using NLTK's TweetTokenizer for social media lexicons
        \subitem \textit{Example: "I LOVE working weekends!" → [I, LOVE, working, weekends, !]}
    \end{itemize}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as supplemental material and cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324, Supplied as supplemental material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
\end{quote}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.
For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.
Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.
Then submit the tech report as supplemental material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool that is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.
For example, let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the 1970 audience would like to hear about your
solution.
The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.
Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
Instead write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
   This system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
   Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
   It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors.
A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B.
\medskip

\noindent
FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double-blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper.
For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge.
Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
Thus, the following is correct:
   ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.
